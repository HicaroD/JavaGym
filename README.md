# ALLinJAVA

Data structures, algorithms, coding problems solutions, design patterns, refactoring techniques and more in Java.

I'm doing it for **educational purposes**, most part of the algorithms and data structures are already available in the Java's ecossystem, but I'm doing it from scratch for fun.
